Tasks for today:

1. Explore Data Structures in python like list, tuple, set, dictionary and their behind the scenes implementation.
2. Explore basic methods in each data structures like fetching items, sorting, mutability and immutability etc.
3. I have shared a pdf of task with you. Please do it yourself. 
Perform multiple iterations and keep in mind of time complexity and space complexity. 
Make seperate py file for each question.  Folder structure: Day_1/1.py ..... .
I will also share you the bitbucket repository and you have to push your changes in that repository.

Lab Questions:

1. Make a list of the largest or smallest N items in a collection. Eg:
Nums = [1, 8, 2, 23, 7, -4, 18, 23, 42, 37, 2] To print largest_three =
largest_3 = [42,37, 23]
smallest_3 = [-4,1,2]
Eg_2 = protfolio = [
{'name': 'ABC', 'shares': 100, 'price': 91.1},
{'name': 'DEF', 'shares': 50, 'price': 543.22}, {'name': 'FB', 'shares': 200, 'price': 21.09}, {'name': 'ABC', 'shares': 300, 'price': 305}
]
find the largest and smallest three portfolios based on their price.
2. You will be given a roman numeral convert it to an integer.
3. Perform calculations i.e (minimum, max, sorting etc) on a dictionary of data.
4. Eliminate duplicate from the sequence preserving the order of the items.
5. You have a sequence of items, and youâ€™d like to determine the most frequently occurring items
in the sequence.
