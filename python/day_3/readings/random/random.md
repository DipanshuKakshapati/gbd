# random.seed(365)

### Why Use random.seed()?

##### Reproducibility: 
The primary reason to set a seed for the random number generator is to ensure that the sequence of random numbers generated is the same each time the code is run. This is crucial when debugging or sharing code with others, as it ensures that everyone sees the same output from functions that generate random numbers.

##### Testing: 
In testing environments, particularly in software development and data science, it is essential that experiments are repeatable. Setting a fixed seed ensures that random operations do not introduce variability between test runs.

### How It Works:

The random module in Python uses a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) called the Mersenne Twister, which generates sequences of numbers that appear random but are actually determined by the initial seed value. When you set the seed using random.seed(365), you're essentially starting the number generation process from a fixed point. This means every time you run your code, as long as you set the same seed before generating random numbers, the same sequence of numbers will be generated.
