--Aggregate Function--

A function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.

Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement.
The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.
