--LIKE()--

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

 The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 The underscore sign _ represents one, single character

Example:

Select all customers that starts with the letter "a":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';


Return all customers from a city that starts with 'L' followed by one wildcard character, then 'nd' and then two wildcard characters:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city LIKE 'L_nd__';


Return all customers from a city that contains the letter 'L':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city LIKE '%L%';


Return all customers that ends with 'a':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';


Return all customers that contains the phrase 'or'

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';


Return all customers that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';


Return all customers that have "r" in the second position:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';


Return all customers from Spain:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country LIKE 'Spain';
