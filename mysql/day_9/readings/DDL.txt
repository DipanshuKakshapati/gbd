--DDL--

Data Definition Language:

A subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define the structure of the database schema. 
It's focused on defining and modifying the structure of database objects such as tables, views, indexes, etc. 
DDL statements do not directly deal with the data itself but rather the organization and structure of the data. Common DDL statements include:

1. CREATE: Used to create database objects like tables, views, indexes, etc.

Creating a new table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);

2. ALTER: Modifies the structure of existing database objects.

Adding a new column to an existing table
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);

3. DROP: Deletes database objects.

Dropping a table
DROP TABLE Employees;

4. TRUNCATE: Removes all records from a table, but keeps its structure intact.

Removing all records from a table
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
