# Complex number

1. Complex Number: A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a+bi, where a and 𝑏 are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit with the property i^2=−1. The value a is called the real part, and b is called the imaginary part of the complex number.

2. Real Number: A real number is a value that represents a quantity along a continuous line. This includes all the integers, fractions, and irrational numbers (like π and root(2)). Real numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long line called the number line.

3. Imaginary Number: An imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit i, which is defined by its property i^2

Conjugate of a Complex Number: The conjugate of a complex number is formed by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the complex number. For example, the conjugate of the complex number
