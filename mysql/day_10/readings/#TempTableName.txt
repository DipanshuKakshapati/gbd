--#TempTableName.txt--

The INTO #TempEmployee clause in a SELECT statement is used to create a temporary table and insert the selected rows into this table. 
Temporary tables are used to store intermediate results and are automatically dropped when the session that created them is closed.

Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
INTO #TempTableName
FROM source_table
WHERE conditions;

Key Points
- Temporary Table Naming: The # symbol indicates that the table is a temporary table. 
  Temporary tables are stored in the tempdb database and are specific to the session or scope in which they are created.
- Table Creation: The SELECT INTO statement creates the temporary table on-the-fly, with columns and data types based on the columns in the SELECT list.
- Data Insertion: The rows returned by the SELECT statement are inserted into the newly created temporary table.
