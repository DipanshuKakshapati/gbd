-- Strings --

Lab questions:

1. You need to check the start or end of a string for specific text patters, 
such as filename extensions, URL shcemes, and so on.
 
Eg: ['Makerfile', 'foo.c', 'bar.py', 'spam.c', 'spam.h', 'https://www.python.org']

2. You're trying to match a text pattern using regular expressions, 
but it is identifying the longest possible matches of a patter. 
Instead, you would like to change to find the shortest possible match.

Eg: match the strig enclosed inside " "
'Computer says "no." ==> [no.]
'Computer says "no." Phone says "yes." ==> ['no.', 'yes.'] (corect answer)
                                           ['no." Phone says "yes.'] -> this is wrong

3. You're trying to match a block of text using a regular expression, but you need
the match to span multiple lines.

Eg:
'''/* this is a
...
multiline comment */
'''

4. Explore bytes strings, encoding and decoding of the strings. Provided a text file 
containing some text, write a program that reads the file, converts its contents to bytes,
and saves it as a new file. Then, read the bytes file, decode it back to a string, and print the original text.
