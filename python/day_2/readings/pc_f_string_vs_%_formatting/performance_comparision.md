# f-strings

1. Faster than %-formatting because they are evaluated at runtime. 
2. This means the expression inside the curly braces {} is evaluated at runtime and then formatted. 
3. They are also implemented at a lower level in the Python interpreter, which contributes to their speed.

# %-formatting

1. This is one of the oldest string formatting methods in Python.
2. It is generally slower than f-strings because it parses the format string and processes the types and conversions.
