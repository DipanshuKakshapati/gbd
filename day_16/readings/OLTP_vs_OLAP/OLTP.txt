--OLTP (Online Transactional Processing)--

Designed to manage transactional data, which involve routine transactions of an organization. 
These systems are optimized for handling a large number of short online transactions.

Key Characteristics:

1. Real-time Processing: Transactions are processed in real-time, ensuring that the data is always up-to-date.
2. Data Integrity: High emphasis on maintaining data accuracy and integrity, usually enforced through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
3. High Volume: Capable of processing a large number of transactions per second.
4. Short Transactions: Each transaction is typically very short in duration.
5. Normalization: Database design often involves normalized schemas to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency.
6. Examples: Banking systems, online booking systems, order entry applications, and retail checkout systems.

Usage:

OLTP systems are used in environments where it is crucial to perform and record numerous transactions quickly and accurately, such as retail, banking, and e-commerce.
