--Polymorphism--

- a core concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the ability of different objects to respond in a unique way to the same method call.
- Polymorphism takes advantage of inheritance and method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass) to allow objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 

Types of Polymorphism:

1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding or Method Overloading): 
2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding or Method Overriding): 

Key Concept:

1. Method Overriding
- This is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its parent classes. 
- This means that a subclass can implement a parent class method based on its requirement.
