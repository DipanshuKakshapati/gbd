--io.BytesIO--

1. io.BytesIO is similar to StringIO but is used for binary data.
2. It also provides a file-like interface for byte strings.
3. This is useful for manipulating binary data in memory, such as image files, audio files, or any other type of binary data stream.

Key characteristics of BytesIO include:

1. Binary data handling: Operates on bytes and byte arrays, making it suitable for binary data processing.
2. Read and write access: Like StringIO, you can perform read and write operations.
3. In-memory storage: Data is stored in memory, which allows for fast access and manipulation.
