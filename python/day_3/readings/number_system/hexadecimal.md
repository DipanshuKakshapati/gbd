# Hexadecimal number system

1. Base-16: Hexadecimal uses sixteen unique digits. The first ten digits are 0 to 9, identical to those in the decimal system. The additional six digits are represented by the letters A to F, where A stands for 10, B for 11, C for 12, D for 13, E for 14, and F for 15.

2. Positional Notation: Each position in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16. For instance, in the hexadecimal number 1A3E:
    - E (which is 14 in decimal) is in the 16^0 place (units),
    - 3 is in the 16^1 place (16s),
    - A (which is 10 in decimal) is in the 16^2 place (256s),
    - 1 is in the 16^3 place (4096s).
    So, the decimal equivalent of 1A3E is 1 × 4096 + 10 × 256 + 3 × 16 + 14 × 1 = 6718 in decimal.

3. Applications: Hexadecimal is widely used in computing, for example, to simplify the representation of binary data. It's common to see hexadecimal values used in programming, especially in contexts like memory addresses, color codes in web design (e.g., #FF5733), and machine code instructions.

4. Arithmetic Operations: Hexadecimal arithmetic, like in other positional systems, includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations follow rules similar to those in decimal arithmetic but adapted to base-16. Each carry-over or borrow occurs after F (15 in decimal) rather than after 9 as in decimal.

5. Conversion: Converting between hexadecimal and binary is straightforward, as each hexadecimal digit directly corresponds to a group of four binary bits. This makes conversion between these two systems very efficient without any need for complex calculations:
    For example, the binary representation of hex A3E is found by converting each hex digit:
    - A = 1010
    - 3 = 0011
    - E = 1110
    Therefore, A3E in binary is 1010 0011 1110.
