# Binary number system

1. Base-2: Unlike the decimal system which is based on ten digits (0 through 9), the binary system uses only two symbols, 0 and 1. Each digit in a binary number is referred to as a bit.

2. Positional Notation: Like the decimal system, binary is a positional value system. Each position represents a power of two, starting from 2^0 on the right. For example, the binary number 1101 represents:
    - 1 x 2^0 = 1
    - 0 x 2^1 = 0
    - 1 x 2^2 = 4
    - 1 x 2^3 = 8
    Thus, 1101 in binary equals to 13 in decimal.

3. Applications: Binary is the core language of computers. Computer processors operate using binary logic, data is stored in binary format, and even complex instructions and data are ultimately broken down into simple binary codes.

4. Arithmetic Operations: Arithmetic in binary is similar to decimal but simpler, using only the digits 0 and 1. Binary arithmetic includes operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
    - Addition: 0 + 0 = 0, 1 + 0 = 1, 0 + 1 = 1, and 1 + 1 = 10    
      (where 10 in binary represents 2 in decimal).
    - Subtraction, multiplication, and division follow similar  
      simplified rules but require bit manipulation and shifts.
