--CASE--

A control flow function that enables you to execute conditional logic directly in your SQL queries. 
It's similar to the "if-then-else" statements in procedural programming languages, allowing you to specify conditions to determine which of several possible results should be returned in your query results.

Basic Syntax:

The CASE statement comes in two primary forms:

1. Simple CASE Expression:

This form is used when comparing a single expression to a set of distinct values.

SELECT Name, StatusId,
    CASE StatusId
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Active'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Inactive'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Pending'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS StatusDescription
FROM Employees;

2. Searched CASE Expression:

This form evaluates a set of Boolean expressions to determine which result to return.

SELECT Name, Salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN Salary >= 100000 THEN 'High Earner'
        WHEN Salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 99999 THEN 'Mid Earner'
        WHEN Salary < 50000 THEN 'Low Earner'
        ELSE 'No Salary Information'
    END AS SalaryCategory
FROM Employees;
