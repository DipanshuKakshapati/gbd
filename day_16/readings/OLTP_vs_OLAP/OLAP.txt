--OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)--

Designed for analyzing and querying large volumes of data. 
These systems are optimized for complex queries and data analysis rather than processing transactions.

Key Characteristics:

1. Data Warehousing: OLAP systems often use data from data warehouses, where data is consolidated from various sources.
2. Complex Queries: Designed to handle complex queries and ad hoc analysis, which can involve large datasets and sophisticated calculations.
3. Data Summarization: Often involves aggregated and summarized data, allowing for multi-dimensional analysis.
4. Low Transaction Volume: Not designed for a high volume of transactional updates, but rather for read-heavy operations.
5. Denormalization: Schemas are typically denormalized (e.g., star schema, snowflake schema) to improve query performance.
6. Examples: Business reporting, data mining, market research analysis, and financial forecasting.

Usage:

OLAP systems are used in scenarios where it is important to analyze large amounts of historical data to support decision-making, strategic planning, and data-driven insights, such as business intelligence and reporting.
