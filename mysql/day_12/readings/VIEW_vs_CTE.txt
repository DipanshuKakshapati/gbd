--CTE--

Common Table Expression (CTE)
1. Scope: A CTE is temporary and only exists during the execution of the query in which it is defined. 
          It disappears once the query is completed.
2. Usage: CTEs are used to simplify complex queries, particularly those that need to reference the same subquery multiple times. 
          They are also helpful in recursive queries, such as when dealing with hierarchical or tree-structured data.
3. Performance: The SQL engine does not store the result of a CTE; therefore, if a CTE is referenced multiple times in the query, 
                it might be re-executed each time leading to potential performance issues.
4. Definition: CTEs are defined using the WITH clause followed by the CTE name, and then the query. 
               The CTE can then be used in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.


--VIEW--

View
1. Scope: A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. 
          It exists until it is explicitly dropped using the DROP VIEW statement.
2. Usage: Views are used to encapsulate complex queries, provide a security mechanism to restrict access to the underlying table columns, 
          and can present a different representation of the data stored in the database.
3. Performance: Views can sometimes improve performance if they are indexed (materialized views). 
                Regular views are not stored on disk, so they are re-executed every time they are called, which can be a performance hit unless the database system caches the results.
4. Definition: Views are created using the CREATE VIEW statement, and they persist in the database schema. 
               Once created, they can be used just like tables in SQL queries.


--Key Differences--

1. Persistence: CTEs are not stored on the database server and are only available during the execution of the query that defines them, 
                whereas views are stored and need to be explicitly dropped.
2. Recursive Queries: CTEs can be defined recursively, which is useful for queries that need to refer to themselves, 
                      such as organizational hierarchies or tree structures. Views cannot be recursive.
3. Performance Considerations: Multiple uses of the same CTE within a query can lead to the CTE being recalculated, potentially impacting performance negatively. 
                               Views, especially materialized ones, can potentially use indexes to improve performance, but regular views might suffer from similar issues if not cached.
