--Denormalization--

Purpose:

1. Improve Query Performance: Denormalization aims to simplify and speed up read-heavy operations by reducing the number of joins required to retrieve related data.
2. Simplify Queries: By combining related data into fewer tables, queries become simpler and faster, which is especially beneficial for analytical operations.

Process:

1. Combining Tables: Data from related tables is combined into larger, more comprehensive tables. This often involves including redundant data.
2. Star Schema and Snowflake Schema: These are common denormalization strategies used in OLAP systems to improve performance and simplify data analysis.

Characteristics:

1. Simplified Queries: Queries are simpler and faster because they require fewer joins.
2. Increased Redundancy: Data redundancy is introduced, which can lead to increased storage requirements.
3. Update Complexity: Updates can be more complex and error-prone because redundant data must be updated in multiple places.
