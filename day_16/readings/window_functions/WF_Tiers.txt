--Tiers--

Tiers involve categorizing rows into different levels or groups based on their values. 
This is often done using the NTILE function as well.

--NTILE--

The NTILE function can create custom groupings, such as deciles, quintiles, or any other tier system.

Example:

SELECT 
    value,
    NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY value) AS decile -- for 10 tiers
FROM 
    your_table;

In this example, the data is divided into 10 groups (deciles). 
Each row is assigned a number from 1 to 10, representing its tier.
