Self Join:

Description: 
A self join is a regular join but the table joins with itself.

Example:
SELECT A.Name AS EmployeeName, B.Name AS ManagerName
FROM Employees A, Employees B
WHERE A.ManagerID = B.EmployeeID;

This is useful for finding relationships within the same table, such as employees and their managers when both are in the same table.
