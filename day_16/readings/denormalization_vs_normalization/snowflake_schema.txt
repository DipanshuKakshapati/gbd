--Snowflake Schema--

A more normalized form of the star schema. In a snowflake schema, dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables. This creates a more complex structure resembling a snowflake.

Components:

1. Fact Table: Same as in the star schema, containing quantitative data.
2. Dimension Tables: Dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables, which reduces data redundancy.

Advantages:

1. Reduced Data Redundancy: Normalizing dimension tables reduces redundancy and can save storage space.
2. More Flexible Data Modeling: Better supports complex relationships between data points.

Disadvantages:

1. More Complex Queries: Queries can become more complex and may require more joins, potentially impacting performance.
2. Slower Query Performance: More joins can slow down query performance compared to the star schema.

Example:

Fact Table: Sales
- SaleID
- ProductID (foreign key to Product table)
- CustomerID (foreign key to Customer table)
- DateID (foreign key to Date table)
- Quantity
- Revenue

Dimension Tables:
- Product: ProductID, ProductName, CategoryID (foreign key to Category table)
- Category: CategoryID, CategoryName
- Customer: CustomerID, CustomerName, RegionID (foreign key to Region table)
- Region: RegionID, RegionName
- Date: DateID, Date, MonthID (foreign key to Month table)
- Month: MonthID, Month, Year
