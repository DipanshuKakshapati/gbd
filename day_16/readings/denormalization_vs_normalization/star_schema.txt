--Star Schema--

A type of database schema that is used to organize data into fact tables and dimension tables. 
It is called a star schema because the diagram of tables resembles a star, with the fact table at the center and the dimension tables radiating outwards.

Components:

1. Fact Table: Contains the quantitative data for analysis (e.g., sales revenue, number of units sold). It has foreign keys that reference dimension tables.
2. Dimension Tables: Contain descriptive attributes related to the facts (e.g., time, product, customer). These tables are typically denormalized, containing redundant data to simplify and speed up queries.

Advantages:

1. Simpler Queries: Easier to write and understand, as the relationships between tables are straightforward.
2. Faster Query Performance: Joins are simpler and faster because each dimension table is directly linked to the fact table.

Example:

Fact Table: Sales
- SaleID
- ProductID (foreign key to Product table)
- CustomerID (foreign key to Customer table)
- DateID (foreign key to Date table)
- Quantity
- Revenue

Dimension Tables:
- Product: ProductID, ProductName, Category
- Customer: CustomerID, CustomerName, Region
- Date: DateID, Date, Month, Year
