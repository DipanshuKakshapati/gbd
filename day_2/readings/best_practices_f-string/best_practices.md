# Best practices

### Readability: Use them when you want to include the value of Python expressions inside strings.
### Expression Embedding: Arithmetic operations, method calls, and more.
### Formatting: Formatting for numbers, dates, padding, alignment, and more.
### Debugging: By including variable names and values succinctly.
### Avoid Complex Expressions: If an expression is too complicated, consider computing its value beforehand and storing it in a variable.
### Escaping Braces: If you need to include literal curly braces in your strings, double them.
