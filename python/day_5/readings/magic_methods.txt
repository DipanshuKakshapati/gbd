--magic_methods--

1. In Python, "magic methods" are special methods which have double underscores at the beginning and the end of their names
2. They are also known as "dunder" methods.
3. These methods are not meant to be directly by us, but instead we can implement and customize our objects in Pythonic ways.
4. Magic methods are mainly used to override or extend the default behavior of Python's built-in operations.


Some commonly used magic keywords:

1. __init__(self, ...)
- Used for initializing a new instance/object of a class.
- It is called right after a new instance/object of a class is created, allowing the class to initialize attributes.

2. __iter__(self)
- Returns an iterator object, which is typically the object itself.
- Here, a class can be used as an iterable, allowing its instances/objects to be used in loops other contexts of iterations.

3. __next__(self)
- Returns the next item in the sequence. 
- On reaching the end, it raises an exception "StopIteration"
- It allows Python to get the next item from the iterator, and it is automatically called by the built-in function next()
