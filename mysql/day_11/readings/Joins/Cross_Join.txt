--Cross Join--

Description: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables. 
This means it returns all possible combinations of rows from the two tables.

Example:
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
CROSS JOIN Departments;

This could be useful for combining every employee with every department, regardless of their actual department assignment.
