--Quartile--

Quartiles divide a data set into four equal parts. 
The first quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of the data.
The second quartile (Q2) is the median of the data set.
The third quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of the data.

--NTILE--

The NTILE function distributes the rows in an ordered partition into a specified number of groups, and assigns a number to each row indicating its group. 
This can be used to calculate quartiles.

Example:

SELECT 
    value,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY value) AS quartile
FROM 
    your_table;

In this example, the data is divided into four groups, with each group representing one quartile.
