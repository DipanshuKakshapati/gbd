--UNION--

the UNION operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set. 
Each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns in the result sets with similar data types. 
The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;


--UNION ALL--

If the tables have overlapping customers and you want to include duplicates

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
