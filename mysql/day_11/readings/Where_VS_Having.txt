--WHERE--

Purpose: 
The WHERE clause is used to filter records before any groupings are made.

Usage: 
It filters rows on the basis of a specified condition and is applied before any aggregate functions are processed. 
This means it can't be used to filter values created by an aggregate function (like SUM, AVG, etc.).

Example: 
Suppose you have a table called Employees and you want to find all employees who belong to the 'Sales' department.

SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales';

In this example, the WHERE clause filters out employees who are not in the Sales department before the rows are returned.

--Having--

Purpose: 
The HAVING clause is used to filter groups created by the GROUP BY clause based on a condition specified by an aggregate function.

Usage: 
It is used after the GROUP BY clause in a query and can filter groups on the basis of conditions involving aggregate functions. 
This means it's specifically designed to work with group functions.

Example: 
If you want to find departments that have more than 10 employees, you would use the HAVING clause to filter these groups.

SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;

Here, the GROUP BY clause groups the employees by department, and the HAVING clause filters out the departments having more than 10 employees.


Key Differences:

Point of Application: 
WHERE is used before the data is grouped, and HAVING is used after the data has been grouped.

Filtering: 
WHERE is used to filter rows, whereas HAVING is used to filter groups.

Compatibility with Aggregate Functions: 
WHERE cannot use aggregate functions; HAVING is specifically designed to use with aggregate functions.
