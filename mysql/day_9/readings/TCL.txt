--TCL--

Transaction Control Language:

Used to manage transactions in the database. 
These commands help ensure that the database remains consistent even in cases of system failures and errors.


1. COMMIT: This command is used to save all the changes made during the current transaction.

BEGIN TRANSACTION; -- Start a new transaction

INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Department) VALUES ('John Doe', 'HR');
UPDATE Employees SET Department = 'Finance' WHERE Name = 'Jane Smith';

COMMIT; -- Saves the changes made in the transaction

2. ROLLBACK: This command is used to undo changes that are made to the database.

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Department) VALUES ('Alice Johnson', 'Marketing');
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Name = 'Bob Brown';

ROLLBACK; -- Undoes both the INSERT and DELETE operations

3. SAVEPOINT: This command allows you to identify a point in a transaction to which you can later roll back.

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Department) VALUES ('Charlie Brown', 'Sales');
SAVEPOINT Savepoint1; -- Set a savepoint here

UPDATE Employees SET Department = 'Tech Support' WHERE Name = 'Charlie Brown';
ROLLBACK TO Savepoint1; -- Roll back to the savepoint, undoing the update

COMMIT; -- Commit the transaction, which includes only the INSERT operation
