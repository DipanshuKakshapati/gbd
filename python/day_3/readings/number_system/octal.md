# Ocatal number system

1. Base-8: In the octal system, each digit represents a power of 8, unlike the decimal system which is based on powers of 10 and the binary system which is based on powers of 2.

2. Positional Notation: Each position in an octal number represents a power of eight, based on its position from the right, starting with 8^0 (which is 1). For example, in the octal number 1752:
    - 2 is in the units place (8)^0
    - 5 is in the eights place (8)^1
    - 7 is in the sixty-fours place (8)^2
    - 1 os in the five-hundred twelve place (8)^3
    So, the decimal equivalent of octal 1752 is 
1 × 512 + 7 × 64 + 5 × 8 + 2 × 1 = 1010 in decimal.

3. Usage: Octal was historically used in computing because it is relatively easy to convert between octal and binary. Each octal digit corresponds directly to three binary digits (or bits). For instance, the octal digit 7 corresponds to the binary 111. However, octal has largely been supplanted by hexadecimal (base-16), which maps even more neatly onto binary, as each hex digit corresponds to four binary digits.

4. Arithmetic Operations: Octal arithmetic is similar to decimal arithmetic but is carried out in base-8. Octal addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed following rules analogous to those used in decimal arithmetic, but carryovers occur whenever a sum reaches eight instead of ten

5. Conversion: Converting between octal and other systems, particularly binary, is straightforward. For example, converting the binary number 110101011 to octal involves grouping the binary digits into sets of three from the right (110 101 011) and then converting each group to its octal equivalent (6 5 3), resulting in octal 653.
