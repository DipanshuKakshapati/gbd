--Inner Join--

Description: 
Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

Example: 
Consider two tables, Employees and Departments. 
An inner join between these tables on the department ID will return only the employees who are assigned to departments.

SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
