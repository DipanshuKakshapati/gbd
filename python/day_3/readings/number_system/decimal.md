# Decimal Number System

1. Base-10: The system is called decimal because it is based on ten unique symbols or digits, from 0 to 9.

2. Positional Notation: Each position in a decimal number represents a power of ten, based on its position from the right, starting with (10)^0 (which is 1). For example, in the number 345:
    - 5 is in the unit place (10)^0
    - 4 is in the tens place (10)^1
    - 3 is in the units place (10)^2

3. Decimal Point: Numbers in the decimal system can include a decimal point. The digits following the decimal point represent fractions, each power being a negative exponent of ten. For instance, in 34.56:
    - 5 is in the tenths place (10)^-1
    - 6 is in the hundredths place (10)^-2

4. Arithmetic Operations: The decimal system supports all standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are taught using the positional values of the digits.

5. Universal Use: The decimal system is used worldwide for most calculations, financial transactions, and in everyday counting and measurement.
